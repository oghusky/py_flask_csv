=========== Sorry forgot to tell you to install Postman
# https://www.postman.com/downloads/

=========== What is Postman?
* Postman - a platform that steps through API request methods

=========== Force install flask
import subprocess
import sys
try:    
    from flask import Flask, render_template, jsonify
except ImportError:
    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', 'flask'])
finally:
    from flask import Flask, render_template, jsonify

============ Lesson Steps

Step 1:
# Show an api with routes and output
# https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts <<< posts
# https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/10 <<< post where id = 10
# https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/10/comments <<< post comments where post id = 10

Step 2:
# Explain request methods
# GET - ask for existing info
# POST - create new info
# PUT - update existing info
# DELETE - remove info

Step 3:
# Explain csv's and why we are using it

Step 4:
# Explain different csv modes: 'r', 'a', 'w'

Step 5:
# Start with this code below
# Print output
# open csv
with open('db.csv') as people_file:
    # sets place in memory
    people = csv.reader(people_file)
    # gets header row
    # takes header row out of future iterations
    header = next(people_file)
    # print("line 6", header)
    for item in people:
        print(item)

Step 6:
# create function from above code
# create first route

Step 7:
# create function that grabs info by id

Step 8:
# to create post_new_person function
# to test in postman choose POST > Body > form-data
## use key and value to enter new person info
